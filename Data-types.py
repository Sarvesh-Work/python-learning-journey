# ** Data Types in python ** 


# Number Type == int , float , Complex : Represents complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. 
# Mapping  Type == dict
# Boolean Type == bool  --- bool or boolean only have or only contain True or False 
# Sequence Type = has  str(string) , list, tuple,range
# Set Type == set, frozenset 
# Binary Type == bytes , bytearray
# None Type == NoneType 

# This are all the data types of python 



#---- variables ----# 
# A variable is a name given to  a memory location in a program
# it is like a container to store any kind of data given by the python
 
  
# {--- sting data type}
name="alex" 
# {--- sting data type}

# int data type
age=23
# int data type

# float data type
hight=6.5
# float data type


# boolean or bool data type
male=True 
# boolean data type

# ---number list----  collection of different data types  
list =[1,3,5,6,7] 

# tuple is similar to the list but we cannot change tuple value once it is declared; it is immutable
tuple = (("alex", "pink", "green", "blue"), ("black", "white"))

# dict data type: A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable, and indexed. In Python, dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
dict = {
    "name": "sarvesh",
    "age": 20,
}



# This is used to print something on the output screen  
print(name)

# using type function we can check the type of variables
print(type(male))
